If you are new to R, an extra amount of hard work should be devoted to make it up. In addition to the official documentations from the R-project, the presentations at a [local SIAM workshop in Spring 2018] (https://siam.math.uconn.edu/events/) given by Wenjie Wang, a PhD student in Statistics at the time, can be enlighting: - https://github.com/wenjie2wang/2018-01-19-siam - https://github.com/wenjie2wang/2018-04-06-siam If you have used R, but never paid attention to R programming styles, a style clinic would be a necessary step. A good place to start is Google’s R style guide at https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml. From my experience, the two most commonly overlooked styles for beginners are spacing and indentation. Appropriate spacing and indentation would immediately make crowdly piled code much more eye-friendly. Such styles can be automatically enforced by R packages such as formatr or lintr. Tow important styles that cannot be automatically corrected are naming and documentation. As in any programming languate, naming of R objects (variables, functions, files, etc.) shoud be informative, concise, and consistent with certain naming convention. Documentation needs to be sufficient, concise, and kept close to the code; tools like R package roxygen2 can be very helpful. See Hadley Wichham’s online book http://style.tidyverse.org/ for more detailed tips. For intermediate R users who want a skill lift, The Advanced R Programming book (Wickham 2014) by Hadley Wickham is available at https://adv-r.hadley.nz/. The source that generated the book is kindly made available at GitHub: https://github.com/hadley/adv-r. It is a great learning experience to complile the book from the source, during which you may pick up many necessary skills. The homework, exam, and project will be completed by R Markdown. Following the step by step the instructions in Yihui Xie’s online book on bookdown (Xie 2016).at https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/, you will be amazed how quickly you can learn to produce cool-looking documents and even book manuscripts. If you are a keener, you may as well following Yihui’s blogdown, see online book https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/, to build your own website using R Markdown. All your source code will be version controlled by git and archived on GitHub. RStudio has made using git quite straightforward. The online tutorial by Jenny Bryan, Happy Git and GitHub for the useR, is a very useful tool to get started 1.1 A Teaser Example: Likelihood Estimation In mathematical statistics, we have learned that, under certain regularity conditions, the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is consistent, asymptotically normal, and most efficient. The asymptotic variance of the estimator if the inverse of the Fisher information matrix. Specifically, let \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) be a random sample from a distribution with density \\(f(x; \\theta)\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is a parameter. How do we obtain the MLE? set.seed(123) n &lt;- 100 x &lt;- rgamma(n, shape = 2, scale = 4) hist(x) Package MASS provides a function fitdistr() to obtain the MLE for univariate distributions with a random sample. We can learn two things from this function. First, an objective function representing the negative loglikelihood is formed, depending on the input of the density function, and fed to the optimizer function optim. Second, the variance estimator of the MLE is obtained by inverting the Hessian matrix of the objective function, which is an estimator of the Fisher information matrix. For commonly used distributions, starting values are not necessary. The function computes moment estimator and use them as starting values.

For example, pretend that someone has a fancy distribution which is just a rename of the gamma distribution. Its density function is defined based on the gamma density dgamma. dfancy &lt;- function(x, shape, scale, log = FALSE) { dgamma(x, shape = shape, scale = scale, log = log) } suppressWarnings(MASS::fitdistr(x, densfun = dfancy, start = list(shape = 10, scale = 20))) ## shape scale ## 2.1931194 3.1400457 ## (0.2897513) (0.4659625) The stats4 package provides MLE using S4 classes. nll &lt;- function(shape, scale) -sum(dfancy(x, shape, scale, TRUE)) suppressWarnings(fit &lt;- stats4::mle(nll, start = list(shape = 10, scale = 10))) stats4::summary(fit) ## Maximum likelihood estimation ## ## Call: ## stats4::mle(minuslogl = nll, start = list(shape = 10, scale = 10)) ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

The first one is the floating number trap. Are you surprised by what you see in the following? ## floating point traps .1 == .3 / 3 ## [1] FALSE seq(0, 1, by = .1) == 0.3 ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE seq(0, 1, by = .1) ## [1] 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 unique(c(.3, .4 - .1, .5 - .2, .6 - .3, .7 - .4)) ## [1] 0.3 0.3 0.3 c(.3, .4 - .1, .5 - .2, .6 - .3, .7 - .4) ## [1] 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 options(digits = 20) .1 ## [1] 0.10000000000000000555 .3 / 3 ## [1] 0.099999999999999991673 How does a computer represent a number? Computers use switches, which has only two states, on and off, to represent numbers. That is, it uses the binary number system. With a finite (though large) number switches on a computer, not all real numbers are representable. Binary numbers are made of bits, each of which represent a switch. A byte is 8 bits, which represents one character. 1.2.1 Integers An integer on many computers has length 4-byte or 32-bit. It is represented by the coefficients \\(x_i\\) in \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{32} x_i 2^{i-1} - 2^{31}, \\] where \\(x_i\\) is either 0 or 1. imax &lt;- .Machine$integer.max imax ## [1] 2147483647 imax + 1L ## Warning in imax + 1L: NAs produced by integer overflow ## [1] NA log(imax, base = 2) ## [1] 30.999999999328192501 u &lt;- 0L b &lt;- 1L for (i in 1L:31L) { u &lt;- u + b b &lt;- b * 2L } ## Warning in b * 2L: NAs produced by integer overflow u ## [1] 2147483647 1000L * 1000L * 1000L ## [1] 1000000000 1000L * 1000L * 1000L * 1000L ## Warning in 1000L * 1000L * 1000L * 1000L: NAs produced by integer overflow ## [1] NA 1000L * 1000L * 1000L * 1000 ## [1] 1e+12 1.2.2 Floating Point A floating point number is represented by \\[ (-1)^{x_0}\\left(1 + \\sum_{i=1}^t x_i 2^{-i}\\right) 2^{k} \\] for \\(x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}\\), where \\(k\\) is an integer called the exponent, \\(x_0\\) is the sign bit. The fractional part \\(\\sum_{i=1}^t x_i 2^{-i}\\) is the significand. By convention (for unique representation), the exponent is chosen so that the fist digit of the significand is 1, unless it would result in the exponent being out of range. A standard double precision representation uses 8 bytes or 64 bits: a sign bit, an 11 bit exponent, and \\(t = 52\\) bits for the significand. With 11 bits there are \\(2^{11} = 2048\\) possible values for the exponent, which are usually shifted so that the allowed values range from \\(-1022\\) to 1023, again with one special sign value. The IEEE standard for floating point arithmetic calls for basic arithmetic operations to be performed to higher precision, and then rounded to the nearest representable floating point number. Arithmetic underflow occurs where the result of a calculation is a smaller number than what the computer can actually represent. Arithmetic overflow occurs when a calculation produces a result that is greater in magnitude than what the computer can represent. Here is a demonstration (Gray 2001). options(digits = 20) .Machine$double.eps ## [1] 2.2204460492503130808e-16 .Machine$double.base ^ .Machine$double.ulp.digits ## [1] 2.2204460492503130808e-16 1 + .Machine$double.eps == 1 ## [1] FALSE 1 + .Machine$double.base ^ (.Machine$double.ulp.digits - 1L) == 1 ## [1] TRUE ## largest possible significand u &lt;- 0 for (i in 1L:53) u &lt;- u + 2^(-i) u ## [1] 0.99999999999999988898 ## and the largest possible exponent--note that calculating 2^1024 ## directly overflows u * 2 * 2 ^ 1023 ## [1] 1.7976931348623157081e+308 ## next largest floating point number overflows (u * 2 * 2 ^ 1023) * (1 + 1/2^52) ## [1] Inf ## smallest possible mantissa and smallest possible exponent 1 / 2^52 * 2^(-1022) ## [1] 4.9406564584124654418e-324 1 / 2^52 * 2^(-1022) / 2 ## [1] 0 1.2.3 Error Analysis More generally, a floating point number with base \\(\\beta\\) can be represented as \\[ (-1)^{x_0}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^t x_i \\beta^{-i}\\right) \\beta^{k}, \\] where \\(x_0 \\in \\{0, 1\\}\\), \\(x_i \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, \\beta - 1\\}\\), \\(i = 1, \\ldots, t\\), and \\(E_{\\min} \\le k \\le E_{\\max}\\) for some \\(E_{\\min}\\) and \\(E_{\\max}\\). For a binary system \\(\\beta = 2\\) while for the decimal system \\(\\beta = 10\\). To avoid multiple representations, a normalized representation is defined by forcing the first significant digit (\\(x_1\\)) to be non-zero. The numbers \\(\\{x: |x| &lt; \\beta^{E_{\\min} - 1}\\}\\) (called subnormals) can not be normalized and, are sometimes excluded from the system. If an operation results in a subnormal number underflow is said to have occurred. Similarly if an operation results in a number with the exponent \\(k &gt; E_{\\max}\\), overflow is said to have occurred. Let \\(f(x)\\) be the floating point representation of \\(x\\). The relative error of \\(f(x)\\) is \\(\\delta_x = [f(x) - x] / x\\). The basic formula for error analysis is \\[ f(x \\circ y) = (1+ \\epsilon_m) (x \\circ y) \\] where \\(\\circ\\) is an operator (e.g., add, subtract, multiple, divide, etc.), \\((x \\circ y)\\) is the exact result, and \\(\\epsilon_m\\) is the smallest positive floating-point number \\(z\\) such that \\(1 + z \\ne 1\\). Add demonstration from Section 1.3 of Gray (2001); see also [notes] (https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~demmel/cs267/lecture21/lecture21.html). (Section 1.4 from Gray) Consider computing \\(x + y\\), where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) have the same sign. Let \\(\\delta_x\\) and \\(\\delta_y\\) be the relative error in the floating point representation of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), respectively (e.g., \\(\\delta_x = [f(x) - x]/x\\), so \\(f(x) = x(1 + \\delta_x)\\)). What the computer actually calculates is the sum of the floating point representations \\(f (x) + f (y)\\), which may not have an exact floating point representation, in which case it is rounded to the nearest representable number \\(f(f(x) + f(y))\\). Let \\(\\delta_s\\) be the relative error of the \\(f(f(x) + f(y))\\). Then, \\[\\begin{align*} &amp;\\,\\, |f(f(x)+f(y)) - x+y)| \\\\ &amp;= |f(f(x)+f(y)) - f(x) - f(y) + f(x)-x+f(y)-y| \\\\ &amp;\\le |\\delta_s[f(x) + f(y)]| + |\\delta_x x| + |\\delta_y y|\\\\ &amp;\\le |x+y|(\\epsilon_m + \\epsilon^2_m) + |x+y| \\epsilon_m \\\\ &amp;\\approx 2\\epsilon_m |x+y|, \\end{align*}\\] where the higher order terms in \\(\\epsilon_m\\) have been dropped, since they are usually negligible. Thus \\(2\\epsilon_m\\) is an (approximate) bound on the relative error in a single addition of two numbers with the same sign. Example 1.1 (Computing sample sum) (Section 1.5.1 of Srivistava (2009)) Let \\(x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\) be the observations from a random of size \\(n\\). The simplest algorithm to compute the sample sum is to start from \\(s_0 = 0\\) and add one term each time \\(s_j = s_{j-1} + x_j\\). Each addition may result in a number that is not a floating number, with an error denoted by multiple \\((1 + \\epsilon)\\) to that number. For example, when \\(n = 3\\), suppose that \\((x_1, x_2, x_3)\\) are floating numbers. We have: \\[\\begin{align*} f(s_1) &amp;= (0 + x_1)(1 + \\epsilon_1)\\\\ f(s_2) &amp;= (f(s_1) + x_2)(1 + \\epsilon_2)\\\\ f(s_3) &amp;= (f(s_2) + x_3)(1 + \\epsilon_3) \\end{align*}\\] It can be seen that \\[\\begin{align*} f(s_3) = (x_1 + x_2 + x_3) + x_1 (\\epsilon_1 + \\epsilon_2 + \\epsilon_3) + x_2 (\\epsilon_2 + \\epsilon_3) + x_3(\\epsilon_3) + o(\\epsilon_m). \\end{align*}\\] The cumulative error is approximately \\[\\begin{align*} &amp;\\phantom{=} \\| f(s_3) - (x_1 + x_2 + x_3)\\| \\\\ &amp;\\sim \\| x_1 (\\epsilon_1 + \\epsilon_2 + \\epsilon_3) + x_2 (\\epsilon_2 + \\epsilon_3) + x_3(\\epsilon_3) \\|\\\\ &amp;\\le \\|x_1\\| (\\|\\epsilon_1\\| + \\|\\epsilon_2\\| + \\|\\epsilon_3\\|) + \\|x_2\\| (\\|\\epsilon_2\\| + \\|\\epsilon_3\\|) + \\|x_3\\| \\|\\epsilon_3\\| \\\\ &amp;\\le (3 \\|x_1\\| + 2\\|x_2\\| + \\|x_3\\|) \\epsilon_m. \\end{align*}\\] This suggests that better accuracy can be achieved at the expense of sorting in increasing order before computing the sum. Todo: design a decimal system with limited precision to demonstrate the error analysis Subtracting one number from another number of similar magnitude can lead to large relative error. This is more easily illustrated using a decimal system (\\(\\beta = 10\\)); see Section~1.4 of Srivastava (2009). For simplicity, consider the case with \\(t = 4\\). Let \\(x = 122.9572\\) and \\(y = 123.1498\\). Their floating point representations are (1230, 3) and (1231, 3). The resulting difference is \\(-0.1\\) while the actual answer is \\(-0.1926\\). The idea is the same on a binary system. Consider an extreme case: \\[\\begin{align*} f(x) &amp;= 1 / 2 + \\sum_{i=2}^{t-1} x_i / 2^i + 1 / 2^t,\\\\ f(y) &amp;= 1 / 2 + \\sum_{i=2}^{t-1} x_i / 2^i + 0 / 2^t. \\end{align*}\\] The absolute errors of \\(f(x)\\) and \\(f(y)\\) are in \\((0, 1/2^{t+1})\\). The true difference \\(x - y\\) could be anywhere in \\((0, 1 / 2^{t-1})\\) The computed subtraction is \\(f(x) - f(y) = 1 / 2^t\\). So the relative error can be arbitrarily large. The error from subtraction operation also explains why approximating \\(e^{x}\\) by partial sums does not work well for negative \\(x\\) with a large magnitude. Consider an implementation of the exponential function with the Taylor series \\(\\exp(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} x^i / i!\\). fexp &lt;- function(x) { i &lt;- 0 expx &lt;- 1 u &lt;- 1 while (abs(u) &gt; 1.e-8 * abs(expx)) { i &lt;- i + 1 u &lt;- u * x / i expx &lt;- expx + u } expx } options(digits = 10) x &lt;- c(10, 20, 30) cbind(exp( x), sapply( x, fexp)) ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 2.202646579e+04 2.202646575e+04 ## [2,] 4.851651954e+08 4.851651931e+08 ## [3,] 1.068647458e+13 1.068647454e+13 cbind(exp(-x), sapply(-x, fexp)) ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 4.539992976e-05 4.539992956e-05 ## [2,] 2.061153622e-09 5.621884467e-09 ## [3,] 9.357622969e-14 -3.066812359e-05 The accuracy is poor for \\(x &lt; 0\\). The problem in accuracy occurs because the terms alternate in sign, and some of the terms are much greater than the final answer. It can be fixed by noting that \\(\\exp(-x) = 1 / \\exp(x)\\). fexp2 &lt;- function(x) { if (x &gt;= 0) fexp(x) else 1 / fexp(-x) } cbind(exp(-x), sapply(-x, fexp2)) ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 4.539992976e-05 4.539992986e-05 ## [2,] 2.061153622e-09 2.061153632e-09 ## [3,] 9.357622969e-14 9.357623008e-14 1.2.4 Condition Number (Wiki) In numerical analysis, the condition number of a function with respect to an argument measures how much the output value of the function can change for a small change in the input argument. This is used to measure how sensitive a function is to changes or errors in the input, and how much error in the output results from an error in the input. The condition number is an application of the derivative, and is formally defined as the value of the asymptotic worst-case relative change in output for a relative change in input. The function'' is the solution of a problem and thearguments’’ are the data in the problem. The condition number is frequently applied to questions in linear algebra, in which case the derivative is straightforward but the error could be in many different directions, and is thus computed from the geometry of the matrix. More generally, condition numbers can be defined for non-linear functions in several variables. A problem with a low condition number is said to be well-conditioned, while a problem with a high condition number is said to be ill-conditioned. The condition number is a property of the problem. Paired with the problem are any number of algorithms that can be used to solve the problem, that is, to calculate the solution. Some algorithms have a property called backward stability. In general, a backward stable algorithm can be expected to accurately solve well-conditioned problems. Numerical analysis textbooks give formulas for the condition numbers of problems and identify the backward stable algorithms. In the exponential function example, the first implementation is unstable for large negative \\(x\\) while the second is stable. It is important in likelihood maximization to work on the log scale. Use argument log in dpq functions instead of taking logs. This can be important in probalistic networks and MC(MC) where \\(P = P_1 · P_2 \\cdots · P_n\\) quickly underflows to zero. It is also important to use log1p and expm1 alike when caculating \\(\\log(1 + x)\\) and \\(\\exp(x)- 1\\) when \\(|x| \\ll 1\\). One example is the evaluation of distribution and density function of the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution. The GEV distribution has distribution function \\[\\begin{equation*} F(x; \\mu, \\sigma, \\xi) = \\begin{cases} \\exp[- \\left[ 1 + \\left(\\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) \\xi\\right]^{-1 / \\xi} &amp; \\xi \\ne 0, \\quad (1 + \\xi (x - \\mu) / \\sigma) &gt; 0,\\\\ \\exp[e^{ -(x - \\mu) / \\sigma}] &amp; \\xi = 0, \\end{cases} \\end{equation*}\\] for \\(\\mu \\in R\\), \\(\\sigma &gt; 0\\), \\(\\xi \\in R\\). curve(evir::pgev(1, xi = x), 1e-20, .01, log=&quot;x&quot;, n = 1025) curve(texmex::pgev(1, 0, 1, x), 1e-20, .01, log=&quot;x&quot;, n = 1025) Figure 1.1: Two implementations of GEV distribution function when \\(\\xi\\) is close to zero. Figure 1.1 shows a comparison of evaluating the GEV distribution function at \\(x = 1\\) for \\(\\mu = 0\\), \\(\\sigma = 1\\), and a sequence of \\(\\xi\\) values near zero using two implementations. 1.3 Exercises Use git to clone the source of Hadley Wickham’s Advanced R Programming from his GitHub repository to a local space on your own computer. Build the book using RStudio. During the building process, you may see error messages due to missing tools on your computer. Read the error messages carefully and fix them, until you get the book built. You may need to install some R packages, some fonts, some latex packages, and some building tools for R packages. On Windows, some codes for parallel computing may not work and need to be swapped out. Document the problems you encountered and how you solved them in an R Markdown file named README.Rmd. Push it to your homework GitHub repository so that it can help other students to build the book. Use bookdown or rmarkdown to produce a report for the following task. Consider approximation of the distribution function of \\(N(0, 1)\\), \\[\\begin{equation} \\Phi(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^t \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-y^2 / 2} dy, \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] by the Monte Carlo methods: \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat\\Phi(t) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n I(X_i \\le t), \\end{equation}\\] where \\(X_i\\)’s are iid \\(N(0, 1)\\) variables. Experiment with the approximation at \\(n \\in \\{10^2, 10^3, 10^4\\}\\) at \\(t \\in \\{0.0, 0.67, 0.84, 1.28, 1.65, 2.32, 2.58, 3.09, 3.72\\}\\) to form a table. The table should include the true value for comparison. Further, repeat the experiment 100 times. Draw box plots of the 100 approximation errors at each \\(t\\) using ggplot2 (Wickham et al. 2018) for each \\(n\\). The report should look like a manuscript, with a title, an abstract, and multiple sections. It should contain at least one math equation, one table, one figure, and one chunk of R code. The template of our Data Science Lab can be helpful: https://statds.org/template/, the source of which is at https://github.com/statds/dslab-templates. Explain how .Machine$double.xmax, .Machine$double.xmin, .Machine$double.eps, and .Machine@double.neg.eps are defined using the 64-bit double precision floating point arithmetic. 1.4 Course Project Each student is required to work independently on a class project on a topic of your choice that involves computing. Examples are an investigation of the properties of a methodology you find interesting, a comparison of several methods on a variety of problems, a comprehensive analysis of a real data with methodologies from the course, or an R package. The project should represent new work, not something you have done for another course or as part of your thesis. I have a collection of small problems that might be suitable. Projects from Kaggle data science competitions may be good choices too. Project proposal is due in week 7, the middle of the semester. This is a detailed, one-page description of what you plan to do, including question(s) to be addressed and models/methods to be used. Project interim report is due in week 12. This informal report will indicate that your project is ``on track’’. The report includes results obtained thus far and a brief summary of what they mean and what remains to be done. Students often start working on this too late. Your do not want to make the same mistake. Final project report is due in the exam week. The final form of the report should use the Data Science Lab template, of no more than 6 pages (single spaced, font no smaller than 11pt, 1 inch margin, with references, graphics and tables included). With more effort, a good project can turn into a paper and be submitted to ENAR student paper competition (Oct. 15) and ASA student paper competition (Dec. 15).

Consider a random sample \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) of size \\(n\\) coming from a univariate distribution with density function \\(f(x | \\theta)\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is a parameter vector. The MLE \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\) of the unknown parameter \\(\\theta\\) is obtained by maximizing the loglikelihood function \\[ l(\\theta) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log f(X_i | \\theta) \\] with respect to \\(\\theta\\). Typically, \\(\\hat\\theta\\) is obtained by solving the score equation \\[ l&#39;(\\theta) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\log f(X_i; \\theta) = 0, \\] i.e., the derivative of the loglikelihood function equated to zero. From mathematical statistics, it is known that, under certain regularity conditions, \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbb{E}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\log f(X; \\theta) &amp;= 0,\\\\ \\mathbb{E}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\log f(X; \\theta) \\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}\\ log f(X; \\theta) \\right]^{\\top} &amp;= - \\mathbb{E} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\theta \\partial \\theta^{\\top}} \\log f(X; \\theta). \\end{align*}\\] The expectation in the second equation is known as the Fisher information \\(I(\\theta)\\), a nonnegative definite matrix. Large sample results state that, as \\(n \\to \\infty\\), \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\) is consistent for \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\sqrt{n} (\\hat\\theta_n - \\theta)\\) converges in distribution to \\(N(0, I^{-1}(\\theta))\\). The asymptotic variance of \\(\\hat\\theta\\) can be estimated by inverting the observed Fisher information matrix \\(l&#39;&#39;(\\hat\\theta_n)\\). More generally in Statistics, M-estimators are a broad class of extremum estimators obtained by maximizing an data dependent objective function. Both non-linear least squares and maximum likelihood estimation are special cases of M-estimators. The definition of M-estimators was motivated by robust statistics, which contributed new types of M-estimators. When the objective function is smooth, the M-estimator can be obtained by solving the corresponding “score” equation. Clearly, optimization or root-finding are very important in Statistics. 3.1 Univariate Optimizations Optimization and root finding are closely related. Consider maximization of a smooth and differentiable function \\(g(x)\\). A necessary condition at the maximum is \\(f(x) = g&#39;(x) = 0\\). Univariate illustrations help to gain insights about the ideas. 3.1.1 Bisection Method The bisection method repeatedly bisects an interval and then selects a subinterval in which a root must lie for further processing. It is a very simple and robust method, but relatively slow. The method is applicable for solving the equation \\(f(x) = 0\\) for the real variable \\(x\\), where \\(f\\) is a continuous function defined on an interval \\([a, b]\\) and \\(f(a)\\) and \\(f(b)\\) have opposite signs. This method is illustrated with an animation using the package animation (Xie 2017). animation::bisection.method() 3.1.2 Newton’s Method A fast approach to find roots of a differentiable function \\(f(x)\\). The methods starts from some initial value \\(x_0\\), and for \\(t = 0, 1, \\ldots\\), compute \\[\\begin{align*} x_{t+1} = x_t - \\frac{f(x_t)}{f&#39;(x_t)} \\end{align*}\\] until \\(x_t\\) converges. The method is based on a linear expansion of \\(f(x)\\). The method is also known as Newton–Raphson iteration. It needs an initial value \\(x_0\\). If \\(f(x) = 0\\) has multiple solutions, the end result depends on \\(x_0\\). Applied to optimization of \\(g\\), this method requires the Hessian \\(g&#39;&#39;\\), which can be difficult to obtain, especially for multivariate functions. Many variants of Newton’s method avoid the computation of the Hessian. For example, to obtain MLE with likelihood \\(l(\\theta)\\), Fisher scoring replaces \\(-l&#39;&#39;(\\theta_t)\\) with \\(I(\\theta_t)\\). Generally, one uses Fisher scoring in the beginning to make rapid improvements, and Newton’s method for refinement near the end. The secant method approximates \\(f&#39;(x_t)\\) by \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{f(x_t) - f(x_{t-1})}{x_t - x_{t-1}}. \\end{align*}\\] Given initial values \\(x_0\\) and \\(x_1\\), the iteration is \\[\\begin{align*} x_{t+1} = x_t - \\frac{f(x_t)(x_t- x_{t-1})}{f(x_t) - f(x_{t-1})}. \\end{align*}\\] 3.1.3 Fixed Point Iteration A fixed point of a function is a point whose evaluation by that function equals to itself, i.e., \\(x=G(x)\\). Fixed point iteration: the natural way of hunting for a fixed point is to use \\(x_{t+1}=G(x_t)\\). Definition 3.1 A function \\(G\\) is contractive on \\([a,b]\\) if \\[\\begin{align*} (1).\\,\\, &amp; G(x)\\in [a,b] \\mbox{ whenever } x\\in [a,b],\\\\ (2).\\,\\, &amp; |G(x_1) - G(x_2)| \\leq \\lambda |x_1-x_2| \\mbox{ for all } x_1,x_2\\in [a,b] \\mbox{ and some } \\lambda\\in [0,1). \\end{align*}\\] Theorem 3.1 If \\(G\\) is contractive on \\([a,b]\\), then there is a unique fixed point \\(x^*\\in [a,b]\\), and the fixed point iteration convergence to it when starting inside the interval. Convergence: \\(|x_{t+1}-x_{t}|=|G(x_t)-G(x_{t-1})|\\leq \\lambda |x_t - x_{t-1}|\\leq \\lambda^{t}|x_1-x_0| \\rightarrow 0\\), as \\(t\\rightarrow \\infty\\). It follows that \\(\\{x_t\\}\\) convergent to a limit \\(x^*\\). Application in root finding: for solving \\(f(x)=0\\), we can simply let \\(G(x) = x + \\alpha f(x)\\), where \\(\\alpha \\neq 0\\) is a constant. Required Lipschitz condition: \\(|x - y + \\alpha [f(x) - f(y)]| \\le \\lambda|x-y|\\), for some \\(\\lambda \\in [0,1)\\) and for all \\(x,y\\in [a,b]\\). This holds if \\(|G&#39;(x)|\\leq \\lambda\\) for some \\(\\lambda \\in [0,1)\\) and for all \\(x\\in [a,b]\\), i.e., \\(|1+\\alpha f&#39;(x)|\\leq\\lambda\\). (use mean value theorem.) Newton’s methods: \\(G(x) = x - f(x)/f&#39;(x)\\). So it is as if \\(\\alpha_t\\) is chosen adaptively as \\(\\alpha_t=-1/f&#39;(x_t)\\). This leads to a faster convergence order (quadratic). 3.2 Multivariate Optimization Consider maximizing a real-valued objective function \\(g(x)\\) of \\(p\\)-dimensional vector \\(x\\). 3.2.1 Newton-Raphson Method The Newton-Raphson method is a generalization of univariate Newton’s root finding algorithm to the multivariate case. 3.2.2 Variants of Newton-Raphson Method The motivation is to avoid the calculation of the Hessian matrix in updatings with the form \\[ x^{(t + 1)} = x^{(t)} - (M^{(t)})^{-1} g&#39;(x), \\] where \\(g&#39;\\) is the gradient of \\(g\\) and \\(M\\) is a substitute of \\(g&#39;&#39;(x)\\). 3.2.2.1 Fisher Scoring Choose \\(M\\) as the negative Fisher information matrix. For location-families, it can be shown that the information matrix is free of the location parameter. 3.2.2.2 Steepest Ascent Choose \\(M = \\alpha^{(t)} I_p\\) for \\(\\alpha^{(t)} &gt; 0\\) so the updating in the direction of he steepest ascent. 3.2.2.3 Discrete Newton Approximate the Hessian matrix with finite-difference quotients. 3.2.2.4 Fixed-Point Iteration Choose \\(M^{(t)} = M\\) for all \\(t\\). An example is \\(M = g&#39;&#39;(x_0)\\). 3.2.2.5 Quasi-Newton Rank-one or rank-two update. The celebrated BFGS is a rank-two update method. Box constraints can be allowed with L-BFGS-B. 3.2.2.6 Coordinate Ascent 3.2.2.7 Conjugate Gradient 3.2.2.8 Gauss-Seidel 3.2.2.9 Gauss-Newton 3.2.3 Nelder-Mead (Simplex) Algorithm Not even the gradient is needed.

The EM algorithm is a special case. An MM algorithm operates by creating a surrogate function that majorizes (minorizes) the objective function. When the surrogate function is optimized, the objective function is driven downhill (uphill). The MM can stand for majorization-minimization or minorization-maximization. The algorithm may avoid matrix inversion, linearize an optimization problem, conveniently deal with equality and inequality constraints, and solve a non-differentiable problem by iteratively solving smooth problems. A function \\(g(\\theta \\mid \\theta^s)\\) is said to majorize the function \\(f(\\theta)\\) at \\(\\theta^s\\) if \\[ f(\\theta^s) = g(\\theta^s \\mid \\theta^s), \\] and \\[ f(\\theta) \\leq g(\\theta \\mid \\theta^s) \\] for all \\(\\theta\\). The descent property of the MM algorithm is easy to see. Let \\[ \\theta^{s+1} = \\arg\\min_\\theta g(\\theta \\mid \\theta^s). \\] It follows that \\[\\begin{align*} f(\\theta^{s+1}) \\leq g(\\theta^{s+1} \\mid \\theta^s) \\leq g(\\theta^{s} \\mid \\theta^s) = f(\\theta^s). \\end{align*}\\] The strict inequality holds unless \\(g(\\theta^{s+1} \\mid \\theta^s)=g(\\theta^{s} \\mid \\theta^s)\\) and \\(f(\\theta^{s+1})= g(\\theta^{s+1} \\mid \\theta^s)\\). Therefore, by alternating between the majorization and the minimization steps, the objective function is monotonically decreasing and thus its convergence is guaranteed. par(mar=c(2.5, 2.5, 0.1, 0.1), mgp=c(1.5, 0.5, 0)) f &lt;- function(x) abs(x - 1) + abs(x - 3) + abs(x - 4) + abs(x - 8) + abs(x - 10) curve(f(x), 0, 12) g &lt;- function(x) (x - 5.5)^2 + 15.75 curve(g(x), 0, 12, add = TRUE, col=&quot;blue&quot;) Inequalities are used to devise MM algorithms.

Supporting hyperplanes. Arithmetic-Geometric Mean Inequality. 3.4 An Example: LASSO with Coordinate Descent Coordinate descent algorithms optimize a objective function with respect to a single parameter or a block of parameters at a time, iteratively cycling through all parameters until convergence is reached. How to determine the blocks of parameters is problem-specific. The method is ideal for problems that have a simple closed form solution in a single/lower dimension but lack one in higher dimensions. % The method is also called backfitting or Gauss–Seidel iteration. It is very commonly used in fitting penalized regression. The concept also appears in many well-known estimation problems. The simple technique can be surprisingly efficient and scalable. Consider objective function \\[ f(\\beta) = g(\\beta) + \\sum_{j=1}^{p}h_j(\\beta_j), \\] where \\(g\\) is convex and differentiable and each \\(h_i\\) is convex. The second part is usually non-smooth, but is separable. Coordinate descent start with some initial guess \\(\\beta^{(0)}\\), repeat the following for \\(k=1,2,3...\\): \\[\\begin{align*} \\beta_1^{(k)} &amp; = \\arg\\min_{\\beta_1}f(\\beta_1,\\beta_2^{(k-1)},\\ldots,\\beta_p^{(k-1)}),\\\\ \\beta_2^{(k)} &amp; = \\arg\\min_{\\beta_2}f(\\beta_1^{(k)},\\beta_2, \\beta_3^{(k-1)},\\ldots,\\beta_p^{(k-1)}),\\\\ &amp; \\ldots\\\\ \\beta_p^{(k)} &amp; = \\arg\\min_{\\beta_p}f(\\beta_1^{(k)},\\ldots,\\beta_{p-1}^{(k)},\\beta_p). \\end{align*}\\] It can be shown that if we are at a point \\(\\beta\\) such that \\(f(\\beta)\\) is minimized along each coordinate axis, we have found a global minimizer. Remarks: - Order of cycle through coordinates is arbitrary. - Can replace individual coordinates with blocks of coordinates. - Same idea has been applied to many non-convex problems. - As long as the objective function is monotone decreasing, the convergence is guaranteed. In a linear regression setting, where \\(Y\\) is the response vector and \\(X\\) is the design matrix. Minimize objective function \\[ \\min_{\\beta \\in R^p}\\{\\frac{1}{2n}\\|Y - X \\beta\\|^2 + \\sum_{j = 1}^p p_{\\lambda}(|\\beta_j|)\\}, \\] where \\(\\|\\cdot\\|\\) denotes the \\(L_2\\)-norm, and \\(p_{\\lambda}(\\cdot)\\) is a penalty function indexed by the regularization parameter \\(\\lambda \\geq 0\\). It is often assumed that the covariates are centered and standardized such that the coefficients become comparable. Common penalties: \\(L_0\\) penalty (subset selection) and \\(L_2\\) penalty (ridge regression). Bridge or \\(L_\\gamma\\) penalty, \\(\\gamma &gt;0\\) \\(L_1\\) penalty or Lasso SCAD penalty MCP penalty Group penalties bilevel penalties LASSO stands for &quot;least absolute shrinkage and selection operator’’.

It enjoys some of the favorable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression, producing interpretable models and exhibiting the stability of ridge regression.

Note that \\(\\tilde r_{ij}\\)’s are the partial residual with respect to the \\(j\\)th covariate. The standardized covariates and completion of squares lead to \\[ L_j(\\beta_j; \\lambda) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\beta_j - \\tilde z_j)^2 + \\lambda |\\beta_j| + \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\tilde r_{ij}^2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\tilde z_j^2. \\] This is just a univariate quadratic programming problem.

This means you have to first find the expression for \\(\\mathbb{E}(X \\mid \\theta)\\). Find the MLE for \\(\\theta\\) using the Newton–Raphson method initial value \\(\\theta_0 = \\tilde\\theta_n\\). What solutions do you find when you start at \\(\\theta_0 = -2.7\\) and \\(\\theta_0 = 2.7\\)? Repeat the above using 200 equally spaced starting values between \\(-\\pi\\) and \\(\\pi\\). Partition the values into sets of attraction. That is, divide the set of starting values into separate groups, with each group corresponding to a separate unique outcome of the optimization. 3.5.3 Modeling beetle data The counts of a floor beetle at various time points (in days) are given in a dataset. beetles &lt;- data.frame( days = c(0, 8, 28, 41, 63, 69, 97, 117, 135, 154), beetles = c(2, 47, 192, 256, 768, 896, 1120, 896, 1184, 1024)) A simple model for population growth is the logistic model given by \\[ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}N}{\\mathrm{d}t} = r N(1 - \\frac{N}{K}), \\] where \\(N\\) is the population size, \\(t\\) is time, \\(r\\) is an unknown growth rate parameter, and \\(K\\) is an unknown parameter that represents the population carrying capacity of the environment. The solution to the differential equation is given by \\[ N_t = f(t) = \\frac{K N_0}{N_0 + (K - N_0)\\exp(-rt)}, \\] where \\(N_t\\) denotes the population size at time \\(t\\). Fit the population growth model to the beetles data using the Gauss-Newton approach, to minimize the sum of squared errors between model predictions and observed counts. Show the contour plot of the sum of squared errors. In many population modeling application, an assumption of lognormality is adopted. That is , we assume that \\(\\log N_t\\) are independent and normally distributed with mean \\(\\log f(t)\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\).

Proposed by Dempster, Laird, and Rubin (1977), it is one of the pillars of modern computational statistics. Every EM algorithm has some notion of missing data. Setup: Complete data \\(X = (Y, Z)\\), with density \\(f(x | \\theta)\\). Observed data \\(Y\\). Some function \\(t(X) = Y\\) collapses \\(X\\) into \\(Y\\). Missing data \\(Z\\). The definition of \\(X\\) is left up to the creativity of the statistician. The general idea is to choose \\(X\\) so that the MLE is trivial for complete data. 4.2 EM Algorithm The EM algorithm iterates between the two steps until convergence: E-step: compute the conditional expectation \\[\\begin{equation*} Q(\\theta | \\theta_n) = E [\\log f(X | \\theta) | Y = y, \\theta_n], \\end{equation*}\\] where \\(\\theta_n\\) is the current estimate of \\(\\theta\\). Note that expectation needed is for functions of missing data \\(Z\\) instead of \\(Z\\) itself, although sometimes it can be \\(Z\\) itself. M-step: maximize \\(Q(\\theta | \\theta_n)\\) with respect to \\(\\theta\\) to obtain the new estimate \\(\\theta_{n + 1}\\). Ascent property: Let \\(g(y | \\theta)\\) be the observed likelihood. Then the EM algorithm enjoys the ascent property: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\log g(y | \\theta_{n + 1}) \\ge \\log g(y | \\theta_n). \\end{equation*}\\] It is sufficient to show the minorization inequality: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\log g(y | \\theta) \\ge Q(\\theta | \\theta_n) + \\log g(y | \\theta_n) - Q(\\theta_n | \\theta_n). \\end{equation*}\\] Information inequality: For densities \\(h_1\\) and \\(h_2\\) with respect to measure \\(\\mu\\), \\(E_{h_1} \\log h_1(X) \\ge E_{h_1} \\log h_2(X)\\) with equality only if \\(h_1 = h_2\\) almost everywhere relative to \\(\\mu\\). To prove the ascent property, let \\(h_1(x | y, \\theta) = f(x|\\theta) / g(y | \\theta)\\) and \\(h_2(x | y, \\theta_n) = f(x | \\theta_n) / g(y | \\theta_n)\\) be conditional densities of \\(X\\) on the set \\(\\{x: t(x) = y\\}\\) with respect to some measure \\(\\mu_y\\). 4.3 Example: Clustering by EM Suppose that \\(y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\) form a random sample from a mixture density \\(h(y) = \\sum_{j=1}^k \\pi_j h_j(y | \\theta)\\), where \\(\\pi_j &gt; 0\\), \\(j = 1, \\ldots, n\\), and \\(\\sum_{j=1}^k \\pi_j = 1\\), \\(h_j\\) is the density function of group \\(j\\) with parameter \\(\\theta\\). For example, each group density can be normal with common variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) but with group specific mean \\(\\mu_j\\)’s. Problem: estimate the parameters \\(\\pi_j\\)’s and \\(\\theta\\). Missing data: let \\(z_{ij}\\) be the indicator such that \\(z_{ij} = 1\\) if observation \\(y_i\\) is from group \\(j\\), and zero otherwise. Complete data likelihood: \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^k z_{ij}[\\log \\pi_j + \\log h_j(y_i | \\theta)]. \\] E-step: conditional expectation of \\(z_{ij}\\), \\(w_{ij}\\), given current \\(\\pi_j\\)’s and \\(\\theta\\). By Bayes’ rule, \\[\\begin{equation*} w_{ij} = \\frac{\\pi_j h_j(y_i | \\theta)}{\\sum_{l=1}^k \\pi_l h_l(y_i | \\theta)} \\end{equation*}\\] M-step: with missing values filled by their conditional expectations \\(w_{ij}\\), the maximization step separates \\(\\pi\\) from \\(\\theta\\). Question: what if there is no closed form E-step or M-step? 4.4 Variants of EM 4.4.1 MCEM Classroom examples may give an impression that the E-step consists of replacing the missing data by their conditional expectations given the observed data at current parameter values. Although in many examples this may be the case as the complete loglikelihood is a linear function of the missing data \\(Z\\), it is not quite so in general. When the E-step has no closed-form, it can be approximated by a Monte Carlo process, and this variant of the EM algorithm is known as the Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) Wei and Tanner (1990). The Monte Carlo E-step goes as the following. The sample size can be different from iteration to iteration; smaller sample size may by sufficient earlier on but larger sample sizes are needed in the vicinity of the convergence to control the Monte Carlo error. Importance sampling can be used as well. MCEM routines need to address two challenges Levine and Casella (2001) (1) how do we minimize the computational cost in obtaining an sample? and (2) how do we choose the Monte Carlo sample size? Rejection sampling and importance sampling can be used for the first. For the second, the number of simulations at iterations in which the change in the parameter value is swamped by Monte Carlo error needs to be increased in an automated way. 4.4.2 ECM The Expectation Conditional Maximization (ECM) algorithm Meng and Rubin (1993) is a class of generalized EM (GEM) algorithms (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977), where the M-step is only partially implemented, with the new estimate improving the likelihood found in the E-step, but not necessarily maximizing it. The ECM algorithm replaces the M-step of the EM algorithm with several computationally simpler conditional maximization (CM) steps. Each of these CM-steps maximizes the \\(Q\\)-function found in the preceding E-step subject to constraints on \\(\\theta\\), where the collection of all constraints is such that the maximization is over the full parameter space of \\(\\theta\\). It is essentially coordinate ascend! A CM-step might be in closed form or it might itself require iteration, but because the CM maximizations are over smaller dimensional spaces, often they are simpler, faster, and more stable than the corresponding full maximizations called for on the M-step of the EM algorithm, especially when iteration is required. The ECM algorithm typically converges more slowly than the EM in terms of number of iterations, but can be faster in total computer time. More importantly, the ECM algorithm preserves the appealing convergence properties of the EM algorithm, such as its monotone convergence. 4.5 Standard Errors 4.5.1 Supplemental EM (SEM) Meng and Rubin (1991) proposed a general automated algorithm named SEM to obtain numerically stable asymptotic variance matrix of the estimator from the EM algorithm. The method uses the fact that the rate of convergence of EM is governed by the fractions of the missing information to find the increased variability due to missing information to add to the complete-data variance matrix. Keeping the notation of \\(X = (Y, Z)\\), from the factorization \\[ f(X | \\theta) = g(Y | \\theta) k(Z | Y; \\theta), \\] where \\(f\\), \\(g\\), and \\(k\\) are the joint, marginal and conditional density of their arguments, respectively. The observed loglikelihood is the difference between the complete loglikelihood and the conditional loglikelihood \\[ L(\\theta | Y) = L(\\theta | X) - \\log k(Z | Y; \\theta). \\] Taking the second derivatives, averaging over \\(k(Z | Y; \\theta)\\), and evaluate at the MLE \\(\\theta = \\theta^*\\), we have \\[ I_o(\\theta^* | Y) = I_{oc} - I_{om}, \\] where \\[ I_o(\\theta | Y) = - \\frac{\\partial^2 \\log g(Y | \\theta)}{\\partial\\theta\\partial\\theta^{\\top}} \\] is the observed information matrix, \\[ I_{oc} = E[I_o(\\theta | Y) \\vert Y, \\theta] \\big\\vert_{\\theta = \\theta^*} \\] the conditional expectation of the complete-data observed information given the observed data, and \\[ I_{om} = E\\left[ - \\frac{\\partial^2 \\log k(Z | Y; \\theta)}{\\partial\\theta\\partial\\theta^2} \\big\\vert Y, \\theta\\right] \\big\\vert_{\\theta = \\theta^*} \\] is viewed as the missing information. The interpretation is appealing: \\[ \\mbox{observed information} = \\mbox{complete information} - \\mbox{missing information} \\] which is known as the ``missing information principal’’. The observed information can be written as \\[ I_o(\\theta^* | Y) = (I - R) I_{oc}, \\] where \\(R = I_{om} I_{oc}^{-1}\\). It has been shown that the convergence rate of the EM algorithm is \\(R\\) (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977). If an estimate of \\(R\\) is available, the target variance matrix can be estimated using \\[ I_{oc}^{-1} (I - R)^{-1} = I_{oc}^{-1} + I_{oc}^{-1}R (I - R)^{-1}. \\] The SEM algorithm needs to evaluate \\(I_{oc}^{-1}\\) and \\(R\\). Evaluation of \\(I_{oc}\\) is simplified if \\(X\\) is from an exponential family. It can be obtained simply by substituting the conditional expectation of the sufficient statistics \\(S(Y)\\) found at the last E-step. Non-exponential family cases can be handled by linearization of the complete loglikelihood in terms of \\(S(Y)\\). The computation of \\(R\\) is done numerically. Each element of \\(R\\) is estimated by the component-wise rate of convergence of a ``forced EM’’. Let \\(r_{ij}\\) be the \\((i,j)\\)th element of \\(R\\). Let \\[ \\theta^{(t)}(i) = (\\theta_1^*, \\ldots, \\theta_{i-1}^*, \\theta_i^{(t)}, \\theta_{i+1}^*, \\ldots, \\theta_d^*), \\] that is, only the \\(i\\)th component in the \\(d\\)-dimensional vector \\(\\theta^{t}(i)\\) is active in the sense that other components are fixed at their MLE’s. Given \\(\\theta^*\\) and \\(\\theta^{(t)}\\), one iteration of the EM algorithm can be run to obtain \\(\\tilde\\theta^{(t+1)}(i) = M\\big(\\theta^{(t)}(i)\\big)\\). Then, obtain \\[ r_{ij}^{(t)} = \\frac{\\tilde\\theta_j^{(t+1)}(i) - \\theta_j^*}{\\theta_i^{(t)} - \\theta_i^*}, \\] for \\(j = 1, \\ldots, d\\). This rate approximates the slope of the map of \\(\\theta^{(t + 1)} = M(\\theta^{(t)})\\). 4.5.2 Direct Calculation of the Information Matrix Oakes (1999) derived an explicit formula for the observed information matrix in terms of derivatives of the \\(Q\\) function (conditional expectation of the complete-data loglikelihood given the observed data) invoked by the EM algorithm. Start from the fundamental identity: \\[\\begin{equation} L(\\phi, X) = Q(\\phi&#39; | \\phi) - E_{X\\mid Y,\\phi} \\log k(X \\mid Y; \\phi&#39;) \\tag{4.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(Q(\\phi&#39; \\mid \\phi) = E_{X \\mid Y,\\phi} L_0(\\phi&#39;, X)\\), and \\(L_0\\) is the complete-data loglikelihood. Assuming that the usual exchange of expectation with respect to \\(X\\) and differentiation in \\(\\phi\\) hold for \\(\\log k(X | Y, \\phi)\\). This gives two identities \\[ E_{X\\mid Y,\\phi} \\frac{\\partial\\log k(X\\mid Y; \\phi)}{\\partial \\phi} = 0 \\] and \\[ E_{X\\mid Y,\\phi} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\log k(X\\mid Y; \\phi)}{\\partial\\phi^2} + E_{X\\mid Y,\\phi} \\frac{\\partial \\log k(X\\mid Y; \\phi)}{\\partial \\phi} \\left[\\frac{\\partial \\log k(X\\mid Y; \\phi)}{\\partial \\phi}\\right]^{\\top}. \\] Differentiation of (4.1) in \\(\\phi&#39;\\) gives \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\phi} = \\frac{\\partial Q(\\phi&#39; | \\phi)}{\\partial \\phi&#39;} - E_{X\\mid Y, \\phi} \\frac{\\partial \\log k(X\\mid Y, \\phi&#39;)}{\\partial \\phi&#39;} . \\tag{4.2} \\end{equation}\\] Substituting \\(\\phi\\) with \\(\\phi&#39;\\) makes the second term vanish, which leads to \\[ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\phi} = \\left\\{\\frac{\\partial Q(\\phi&#39; | \\phi)}{\\partial \\phi&#39;} \\right\\}_{\\phi = \\phi&#39;}. \\] Differentiation of (4.2) in \\(\\phi&#39;\\) and \\(\\phi\\) gives respectively \\[ \\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial \\phi&#39;^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial \\phi&#39;^2} - E_{X\\mid Y, \\phi} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\log k(X\\mid Y, \\phi&#39;)}{\\partial \\phi&#39;^2}, \\] and \\[ 0 = \\frac{\\partial^2 Q(\\phi&#39;|\\phi)}{\\partial \\phi&#39;\\partial \\phi} - E_{X\\mid Y, \\phi} \\frac{\\partial \\log k(X\\mid Y, \\phi&#39;)}{\\partial \\phi&#39;} \\left[\\frac{\\partial \\log k(X\\mid Y, \\phi)}{\\partial \\phi} \\right]^{\\top}. \\] Substituting \\(\\phi = \\phi&#39;\\), adding the two equations and using the information identity give \\[ \\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial \\phi^2} = \\left\\{\\frac{\\partial^2 Q(\\phi&#39;|\\phi)}{\\partial \\phi&#39;^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 Q(\\phi&#39;|\\phi)}{\\partial \\phi&#39;\\partial \\phi} \\right\\}_{\\phi&#39; = \\phi}, \\] which is valid for all \\(\\phi\\). The second term is the ``missing information’’ due to the fact that only \\(Y\\) instead of \\(X\\) is observed. If the complete data is from an exponential family, the second term reflects the sensitivity of the imputed complete-data sufficient statistic to changes in hypothesized parameter value. 4.6 Acceleration 4.7 Example: Hidden Markov Model A hidden Markov model (HMM) is a dependent mixture model. The model consists of two parts: 1) a Markov process for the unobserved state process \\(\\{S_t: t = 1, 2, \\ldots\\}\\); and 2) a state-dependent process for the observed data \\(\\{X_t: t = 1, 2, \\ldots\\}\\) such that when \\(S_t\\) is known, the distribution of \\(X_t\\) depends on \\(S_t\\) only and not on previous states or observations. It can be characterized by \\[\\begin{align} \\Pr(S_t \\mid S_1, \\ldots, S_{t - 1}) &amp;= \\Pr(S_t \\mid S_{t-1}),\\quad t = 2, 3, \\ldots, \\\\ \\Pr(X_t \\mid S_1, \\ldots, S_t; X_1, \\ldots, X_{t-1}) &amp;= \\Pr(X_t \\mid S_t), \\quad t = 1, 2, \\ldots. \\end{align}\\] HMMs have a wide range of applications. Suppose that process \\(S_t\\) has \\(m\\) states. Let \\(\\delta\\) be the parameters of the initial distribution of \\(S_t\\). Let \\(\\Gamma\\) be the probability transition matrix of \\(S_t\\). Let \\(\\theta\\) be the parameter vector in \\(\\Pr(X_t | S_t)\\). Given the observed data \\(\\{x_t: t = 1, \\ldots, T\\}\\), these parameters can be estimated by maximizing the an EM algorithm that treats the unobserved states \\(\\{s_t: t = 1, \\ldots, T\\}\\) as missing data. To devise the EM algorithm, we need the complete data loglikelihood. Let \\(u_j(t) = I(s_t = j)\\), \\(t = 1, \\ldots, T\\), \\(j = 1, \\ldots, m\\), and \\(v_{jk}(t) = I(s_{t-1} = j, s_t = k)\\), \\(t = 2, \\ldots, T\\), and \\(j, k \\in \\{1, \\ldots, m\\}\\). The complete data loglikelihood is \\[\\begin{align*} &amp; \\log p(s_1, \\ldots, s_T, x_1, \\ldots, x_T)\\\\ =&amp; \\log \\delta_{s_1} \\prod_{t=2}^T \\Gamma_{s_{t-1}, s_t} \\prod_{t=1}^T p(x_t | s_t; \\theta)\\\\ =&amp; \\log \\delta_{s_1} + \\sum_{t=2}^T \\log \\Gamma_{s_{t-1}, s_t} + \\sum_{t=1}^T \\log p(x_t | s_t; \\theta)\\\\ =&amp; \\sum_{i=1}^m u_j(1) \\log \\delta_j + \\sum_{j=1}^m \\sum_{k=1}^m \\sum_{t=2}^T v_{jk}(t) \\log \\Gamma_{jk} + \\sum_{j=1}^m \\sum_{t=1}^T u_j(t) \\log p(x_t | s_t = j; \\theta) \\end{align*}\\] In the E-step, quantities \\(u_j(t)\\) and \\(v_{jk}(t)\\) needs be replaced with their conditional expectations given \\(\\{x_t: t = 1, \\ldots, T\\}\\). Define row vector \\(\\alpha(t)\\) as \\[ \\alpha(t) = \\delta \\prod_{r=2}^t \\Gamma P(x_r), \\] where \\(P(x_r | \\theta) = diag[p(x_r | 1; \\theta), \\ldots, p(x_r | m; \\theta)]\\). This is indeed a probability vector, known as the forward probability, because the \\(j\\)th component is \\(\\alpha_j(t) = p(x_1, \\ldots, x_t, s_t = j)\\). Define vector \\(\\beta(t)\\) as \\[ \\beta(t) = \\prod_{r = t + 1}^T \\Gamma P(x_r) \\mathbf{1}, \\] with the convention that an empty product is the identity matrix, where \\(\\mathbf{1}\\) is the column vector of ones. This is also a probability vector, known as the backward probability, because the \\(j\\)th component is \\(\\beta_j(t) = p(x_{t+1}, \\ldots, x_T | s_t = j)\\). The forward probabilities are affected by the initial probabilities \\(\\delta\\), and the model does not need to assume stationarity of \\(S_t\\). The backward probabilities, however, are not affected by stationarity of \\(S_t\\). It follows that for all \\(t \\in \\{1, \\ldots, T\\}\\) and \\(j \\in \\{1, \\ldots, m\\}\\), \\[ \\alpha_j(t) \\beta_j(t) = p(x_1, \\ldots, x_T, s_t = j). \\] Consequently, \\(\\alpha(t) \\beta(t) = p(x_1, \\ldots, x_T) = L_T\\) for each \\(t\\). It can be verified that, for \\(t \\in \\{1, \\ldots, T\\}\\), \\[\\begin{equation} p(S_t = j | x_1, \\ldots, x_T) = \\alpha_j(t) \\beta_j(t) / L_T, \\tag{4.3} \\end{equation}\\] and that, for \\(t \\in \\{2, \\ldots, T\\}\\), \\[\\begin{equation} p(s_{t - 1} = j, s_t = k | x_1, \\ldots, x_T) = \\alpha_j(t - 1) \\Gamma_{jk} p(x_t | k; \\theta) \\beta_k(t) / L_T. \\tag{4.4} \\end{equation}\\] equation labels cannot contain colon, underscore Equations (4.3) and (4.4), respectively, give the needed conditional expectation in the E-step for \\(u_j(t)\\) and \\(v_{jk}(t)\\) given the observations \\(\\{x_t: t = 1, \\ldots, T\\}\\). In the M-step, the maximization with respect to three sets of parameters \\(\\delta\\), \\(\\Gamma\\), and \\(\\theta\\) can be done separately; each term in the summation depends only on one set. Maximization with respect to \\(\\delta\\) and \\(\\Gamma\\) has closed-form solution, while maximization with respect to \\(\\theta\\) needs to be done numerically in general. 4.8 Exercises 4.8.1 Finite mixture regression Given \\(n\\) independent observations of the response \\(Y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) and predictor \\(\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^p\\), multiple linear regression models are commonly used to explore the conditional mean structure of \\(Y\\) given \\(\\mathbf{X}\\). However, in many applications, the underlying assumption that the regression relationship is homogeneous across all the observations \\((y_1, \\mathbf{x}_1),\\ldots,(y_n, \\mathbf{x}_n)\\) can be easily violated. Instead, the observations may form several distinct clusters indicating mixed relationships between the response and the predictors. Such heterogeneity can be more appropriately modeled by a finite mixture regression model, consisting of, say, \\(m\\) homogeneous groups/components. Suppose the density of \\(y_i\\) (conditional on \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\)), is given by \\[\\begin{eqnarray} f(y_i\\mid \\mathbf{x}_i,\\boldsymbol{\\Psi})= \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\pi_{j}\\phi(y_i;\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{j}, \\sigma^2),\\qquad i=1,\\ldots,n, \\tag{4.5} \\end{eqnarray}\\] where \\(\\pi_j\\)s are called mixing proportions, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_j\\) is the regression coefficient vector for the \\(j\\)th group, \\(\\phi(\\cdot\\:;\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\) denotes the density function of \\(N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\), and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}=(\\pi_1,\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_1,\\ldots,\\pi_m,\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_m,\\sigma)^T\\) collects all the unknown parameters. Maximum likelihood estimation is commonly used to infer the unknown arameter \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}\\) in (4.5), i.e., \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}}_{\\mbox{mle}}=\\arg\\max_{\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\log\\left\\{\\sum_{j=1}^m\\pi_j\\phi(y_i;\\textbf{x}_i^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{j},\\sigma^2)\\right\\}. \\tag{4.6} \\end{equation}\\] The MLE does not have an explicit form and the problem is usually solved by the EM algorithm. Let \\(z_{ij} = 1\\) if \\(i\\)th observation is from \\(j\\)th component} and zero otherwise. Denote the complete data by \\(\\{(\\mathbf{x}_{i}, \\mathbf{z}_{i}, y_{i}); i =1,2,\\ldots,n\\}\\), where the component labels \\(\\mathbf{z}_{i} = (z_{i1}, z_{i2}, \\ldots, z_{im})\\) are not observable or “missing” in practice. The complete log-likelihood can be written as \\[ l_{n}^{c}(\\boldsymbol{\\Psi})=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{m}z_{ij}\\log \\left\\{\\pi_{j}\\phi(y_{i}-\\mathbf{x}_{i}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{j};0,\\sigma^{2})\\right\\}. \\] In the E-step, we calculate the conditional expectation of the complete log-likelihood with respect to \\(\\mathbf{z}_{i}\\), and in the M-step, we maximize the obtained conditional expectation with respect to \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}\\). At the \\(k\\)th iteration, the E-Step computes the conditional expectation of \\(l_{n}^{c}(\\boldsymbol{\\Psi})\\): \\[\\begin{align*} Q(\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}\\mid \\boldsymbol{\\Psi}^{(k)}) =\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{m}p_{ij}^{(k+1)} \\left\\{\\log\\pi_{j}+\\log\\phi(y_{i}-\\textbf{x}_{i}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{j};0,\\sigma^{2})\\right\\}, \\end{align*}\\] where \\[\\begin{align*} p_{ij}^{(k+1)}&amp;=E(z_{ij}\\mid y_{i},\\textbf{x}_{i};\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}^{(k)}) =\\frac{\\pi_{j}^{(k)}\\phi(y_{i}-\\textbf{x}_{i}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{j}^{(k)};0,\\sigma^{2^{(k)}})}{\\sum_{j=1}^{m}\\pi_{j}^{(k)}\\phi(y_{i}-\\textbf{x}_{i}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{j}^{(k)};0,\\sigma^{2^{(k)}})}. \\end{align*}\\] The M-Step maximizes \\(Q(\\boldsymbol{\\Psi} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\Psi}^{(k)})\\) to obtain \\[\\begin{align*} \\pi_{j}^{(k+1)} &amp;=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_{ij}^{(k+1)}}{n}\\\\ \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{j}^{(k+1)}&amp;=\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\textbf{x}_i\\textbf{x}_{i}^{\\top}p_{ij}^{(k+1)}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\textbf{x}_ip_{ij}^{(k+1)}y_i\\right),\\qquad j=1,\\ldots,m;\\\\ \\sigma^{2^{(k+1)}}&amp;=\\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{m}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_{ij}^{(k+1)}(y_{i}-\\textbf{x}_{i}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{j}^{(k+1)})^{2}}{n}. \\end{align*}\\] Follow the lecture notes to verify the validity of the provided E- and M-steps. That is, derive the updating rules in the given algorithm based on the construction of an EM algorithm. Implement this algorithm in R with a function regmix_em. The inputs of the functions are y for the response vector, xmat for the design matrix, pi.init for initial values of \\(\\pi_j\\)’s (a vector of \\(K\\times 1\\) vector), beta.init for initial values of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_j\\)’s (a matrix of \\(p \\times K\\) where \\(p\\) is ncol(xmat) and \\(K\\) is the number of components in the mixture), sigma.init for initial values of \\(\\sigma\\), and a control list for controlling max iteration number and convergence tolerance. The output of this function is the EM estimate of all the parameters. Here is a function to generate data from the mixture regression model. regmix_sim &lt;- function(n, pi, beta, sigma) { K &lt;- ncol(beta) p &lt;- NROW(beta) xmat &lt;- matrix(rnorm(n * p), n, p) # normal covaraites error &lt;- matrix(rnorm(n * K, sd = sigma), n, K) ymat &lt;- xmat %*% beta + error # n by K matrix ind &lt;- t(rmultinom(n, size = 1, prob = pi)) y &lt;- rowSums(ymat * ind) data.frame(y, xmat) } Generate data with the following and estimate the parameters. n &lt;- 400 pi &lt;- c(.3, .4, .3) bet &lt;- matrix(c( 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -1), 2, 3) sig &lt;- 1 set.seed(1205) dat &lt;- regmix_sim(n, pi, bet, sig) ## regmix_em(y = dat[,1], xmat = dat[,-1], ## pi.init = pi / pi / length(pi), ## beta.init = bet * 0, ## sigma.init = sig / sig, ## control = list(maxit = 500, tol = 1e-5)) 4.8.2 A Poisson-HMM for earthquake data Consider a \\(m\\)-state HMM where the observed data follows a Poisson distribution with mean \\(\\lambda_i\\) for state \\(i\\), \\(i = 1, \\ldots, m\\), respectively. This model has three sets of parameters initial distribution \\(\\delta\\), transition probability matrix \\(\\Gamma\\), and Poisson means \\(\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_m)\\). Suppose the observed data is a vector \\(x\\). Write a function that implements the EM algorithm for this model with these argument: x: the observed data; m: the number of states; lambda: initial value of \\(\\lambda\\); Gamma: initial value of \\(\\Gamma\\); delta: initial value of \\(\\delta\\); control: a named list similar to that specifies the tolerance, maximum number of iteration, and whether or not trace the iteration. Apply the function to model the frequency of major earthquakes (magnitude 7 or above) in the world from 1900 to 2015 with a 2-state HMM and a 3-state HMM. ## frequency of major earthquake in the world from 1900 to 2015 ## raw data accessed at http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/ qk7freq &lt;- c(3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 5, 8, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 3, 4, 6, 4, 8, 5, 12, 8, 7, 9, 7, 12, 9, 12, 13, 11, 16, 15, 9, 19, 9, 8, 12, 14, 11, 9, 21, 14, 7, 13, 11, 18, 13, 5, 10, 13, 11, 9, 13, 11, 7, 9, 6, 10, 8, 21, 8, 8, 13, 12, 10, 17, 12, 18, 9, 11, 22, 14, 17, 20, 16, 9, 11, 13, 14, 10, 12, 8, 6, 10, 7, 14, 14, 15, 11, 13, 11, 9, 18, 17, 13, 12, 13, 20, 15, 16, 12, 18, 15, 16, 13, 15, 16, 11, 11, 18, 12, 17, 24, 20, 16, 19, 12, 19) ## forward/backward probability for Poisson-HMM from ## Zucchini and MacDonald (2009): ## Hidden Markov Models for Time Series: An Introduction with R. pois.HMM.lalphabeta &lt;- function(x, m, lambda, gamma, delta = NULL) { if (is.null(delta)) delta &lt;- solve(t(diag(m) - gamma + 1), rep(1, m)) n &lt;- length(x) lalpha &lt;- lbeta &lt;- matrix(NA, m, n) allprobs &lt;- outer(x, lambda, dpois) foo &lt;- delta * allprobs[1, ] sumfoo &lt;- sum(foo) lscale &lt;- log(sumfoo) foo &lt;- foo/sumfoo lalpha[, 1] &lt;- log(foo) + lscale for (i in 2:n) { foo &lt;- foo %*% gamma * allprobs[i, ] sumfoo &lt;- sum(foo) lscale &lt;- lscale + log(sumfoo) foo &lt;- foo/sumfoo lalpha[, i] &lt;- log(foo) + lscale } lbeta[, n] &lt;- rep(0, m) foo &lt;- rep(1/m, m) lscale &lt;- log(m) for (i in (n - 1):1) { foo &lt;- gamma %*% (allprobs[i + 1, ] * foo) lbeta[, i] &lt;- log(foo) + lscale sumfoo &lt;- sum(foo) foo &lt;- foo/sumfoo lscale &lt;- lscale + log(sumfoo) } list(la = lalpha, lb = lbeta) } References "],
["random-number-generation.html", "Chapter 5 Random Number Generation 5.1 Univariate Random Number Generation 5.2 Exercises", " Chapter 5 Random Number Generation (Wiki) A pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), also known as a deterministic random bit generator (DRBG), is an algorithm for generating a sequence of numbers whose properties approximate the properties of sequences of random numbers. The PRNG-generated sequence is not truly random, because it is completely determined by a relatively small set of initial values, called the PRNG’s seed (which may include truly random values). 5.1 Univariate Random Number Generation Random number from standard uniform distribution \\(U(0, 1)\\) is crucial. To illustrate that pseudorandom numbers are deterministic, consider a multiplicative random number generator \\[ I_{n+1} = 7^5 I_n\\mathrm{mod} (2^{31} - 1). \\] runif.my &lt;- function(n, seed) { ret &lt;- double(n) last &lt;- seed p &lt;- 2^31 - 1 for (i in 1:n) { last &lt;- (7^5 * last) %% p ret[i] &lt;- last / p } ret } u &lt;- runif.my(1000, 2) The randomness can be viewed from a histogram and can be tested, for example, with the KS test. hist(u) ks.test(u, &quot;punif&quot;) ## ## One-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test ## ## data: u ## D = 0.020604, p-value = 0.7896 ## alternative hypothesis: two-sided In , check . We assume that generation from \\(U(0,1)\\) has been solved for all practical purposes and focus on turning uniform variables to variables with other desired distributions. 5.1.1 Inverse CDF For a non-decreasing function \\(F\\) on \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), the generalized inverse of \\(F\\), \\(F^-\\), is the function \\[ F^-(u) = \\inf\\{x: F(x) \\ge u\\}. \\] If \\(U\\) is \\(U(0, 1)\\), then \\(F^-(U)\\) has distribution \\(F\\). For continuous variables, \\(F^-\\) is simply \\(F^{-1}\\), the quantile function or inverse probability integral transformation. This works for both continuous and non-continuous variables. Average numbers of searches for Poisson variate generation with mean \\(\\lambda\\) (Ross’s Simulation book, p.51). Given a \\(U\\), the inversion algorithm successively checks if the Poisson variate is 0, 1, 2, and so on, which on average takes \\(1 + \\lambda\\) searches. It can be greatly improved by first checking on the integers that are closest to \\(\\lambda\\). Let \\(I\\) be the integer part of \\(\\lambda\\). To generate a Poisson variate \\(X\\), check whether or not \\(X \\le I\\) by seeing whether or not \\(U \\le F(I)\\). Then search downward starting from \\(I\\) if \\(X \\le I\\) and upward from \\(I + 1\\) otherwise. On average the number of searches needed by this algorithm is roughly 1 more than the mean absolute difference between \\(X\\) and \\(\\lambda\\). By \\(N(\\lambda, \\lambda)\\) approximation, this is approximately \\[ 1 + E |X - \\lambda| = 1 + 0.798 \\sqrt{\\lambda}. \\] The {rpois()} function in R uses an efficient algorithm that generates variables for \\(\\lambda \\ge 10\\) by truncating suitable normal deviates and applying a correction with low probability (Ahrens and Dieter 1982). 5.1.2 Rejection Method Idea: To sample from \\(f\\), we sample from \\(g\\) and accept the sample with certain rate to make sure the resulting variable follows \\(f\\). Setup: 1) densities \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) has the same support. 2) \\(f(x) \\le M g(x)\\) for some \\(M &gt; 0\\). The rejection algorithm: Generate \\(Y\\) from \\(g\\). Generate \\(U\\) from standard uniform. If \\(U \\le f(Y) / [M g(Y)]\\), output \\(X = Y\\); otherwise, return to step 1. Validity proof: For \\(x\\) in \\(\\mathcal{X}\\), the support of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\), show that \\(\\Pr(X \\le x) = \\Pr(Y \\le x \\mid \\mbox{Accept}) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x f(y) \\mathrm{d}y\\). Fundamental theorem of simulation: Simulating from \\(X \\sim f(x)\\) is equivalent to simulating from \\((X, U) ~ \\mathcal{U}\\{\\{x, u\\}: 0 &lt; u &lt; f(x)\\}\\). (Hint: the marginal density of \\(X\\) is \\(f(x)\\).) Efficiency: The probability of acceptance is exactly \\(1 / M\\). The expected number of trials until a variable is accepted is \\(M\\). Among choices of \\(g\\), \\(g_i\\)’s, the optimal sampler minimizes \\(M\\). 5.2 Exercises 5.2.1 Rejection sampling Let \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) be two probability densities on \\((0,\\infty)\\), such that \\[\\begin{align*} f(x) \\propto \\sqrt{4+x}\\,x^{\\theta-1} e^{-x}, \\quad g(x) \\propto (2 x^{\\theta-1} + x^{\\theta-1/2}) e^{-x}, \\quad x&gt;0. \\end{align*}\\] Find the value of the normalizing constant for \\(g\\), i.e., the constant \\(C\\) such that \\[\\begin{align*} C\\int_0^\\infty (2 x^{\\theta-1} + x^{\\theta-1/2}) e^{-x} \\mathrm{d}x=1. \\end{align*}\\] Show that \\(g\\) is a mixture of Gamma distributions. Identify the component distributions and their weights in the mixture. Design a procedure (pseudo-code) to sample from \\(g\\); implement it in an R function; draw a sample of size \\(n = 10,000\\) using your function for at least one \\(\\theta\\) value; plot the kernel density estimation of \\(g\\) from your sample and the true density in one figure. Design a procedure (pseudo-code) to use rejection sampling to sample from \\(f\\) using \\(g\\) as the instrumental distribution. Overlay the estimated kernel density of a random sample generated by your procedure and \\(f\\). 5.2.2 Mixture Proposal Let \\(f\\) be a probability density on \\((0,1)\\) such that \\[\\begin{align*} f(x) \\propto \\frac{x^{\\theta-1}}{1+x^2} + \\sqrt{2+x^2} (1-x)^{\\beta-1}, \\quad 0&lt;x&lt;1. \\end{align*}\\] Design a procedure (pseudo-code) to sample from \\(f\\) using a mixture of Beta distributions as the instrumental density. That is, the instrumental density should have the form \\[\\begin{align*} \\sum_{k=1}^m p_k g_k(x), \\end{align*}\\] where \\(p_k\\) are weights and \\(g_k\\) are densities of Beta distributions. Specify your choice of the mixture. Implement your algorithm in an R function. Graph the estimated density of a random sample of \\(n = 10,000\\) generated by your procedure and \\(f\\) for at least one \\((\\theta, \\beta)\\). As shown in class, \\(f(x)\\) can also be sampled using rejection sampling, by dealing with the two components \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x^{\\theta-1}}{1+x^2}, \\quad \\sqrt{2+x^2} (1-x)^{\\beta-1} \\end{align*}\\] separately using individual Beta distributions. Design a procedure (pseudo-code) to do this; implement it with an R function; overlay the estimated density of a random sample of size \\(n = 10,000\\) generated by your procedure and \\(f\\).
